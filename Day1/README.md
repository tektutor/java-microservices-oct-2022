# Day 1 - React JS

## What is DOM ?
- DOM is Document Object Model
- DOM is a tree style object
- is a programming interface for web documents
- it represents the web page
- an object oriented representation of a web page
- reprents structure, style and content of the web page
- DOM object has one or more HTML elements
- Examples of HTML element
  - <input> element that accepts input from end-user 
  - <button> element that allows you to submit the information to server/local for further processing
 
  
  
## Framework vs Library

## JavaScript
- scripting language that is supported by almost all web browsers
- Web browsers under HTML
- Web browsers under DOM 
- each time the user types or modifies any properties on your web page, the entire DOM is replaced which is inefficient
- as even smaller updates end-up replacing the entire DOM, the web page will have performance impacts
  
## What is React JS ?
- is an open source javascript library developed by Facebook
- it is very small library compared to Angular JS or Vue JS Frameworks
- hence it is easy to learn
- each time there is an update, first the Virtual DOM managed by React is updated in-memory, React then compares the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM in the web page, React then only updates the portion that is different between the Virtual and Actual DOM
- hence web applications developed using ReactJS Javascript library is faster compared to other Web Frameworks

## Angular JS
- is a web application development Framework
- it provides complete solution to develop a web application
- we get very less choice to choose the third-party javascript libaries as the Framework makes such choice for us
- learning a big framework like Angular JS is difficult compared to React JS
